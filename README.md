# Wikit - A universal dictionary

# What is it?

To be short, Wikit is a tool which can (fully, may be in future) render and create dictionary file
in MDX/MDD format.

This project is in very early stage, but you can try this [demo](http://106.53.152.194/wikit/)
online or download electron wrapped client from here
[Releases](https://github.com/ikey4u/wikit/releases).

# Why it?

MDX/MDD is a popular closed-source dictionary format which you can find many dictionaries made by a
variety of folks on [pdawiki](https://www.pdawiki.com) or [freemdict](https://freemdict.com/).
All of these should give appreciations to the hero of `xwang` who firstly released full
reverse-engineering analysis of MDX/MDD format, which you can find
[here](https://bitbucket.org/xwang/mdict-analysis/src/master/).

Several reasons make me write this project

- I am a heavy user of dictionary since I often read english books or papers
- For what I can tell now, no project about MDX/MDD is actively maintained
- No platform-agnostic, user-friendly, fully-opensourced and free dictionary for now
- I love rust programming

# Installation and Usage

There is no GUI but only CLI for Wikit for now, you can download the tool from [release](https://github.com/ikey4u/wikit/releases) page.

Decompress the release packege and just fireup the tool `wikit`, you will see detail help information,
for example

    wikit 0.1.0
    ikey4u <pwnkeeper@gmail.com>
    A universal dictionary - Wikit

    USAGE:
        wikit [SUBCOMMAND]

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    SUBCOMMANDS:
        help      Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
        mdx       Process MDX file
        server    Run wikit as an API server

There are serveral subcommands: `mdx` and `server`. However `server` is not stable for now,
please use it carefully. For `mdx` subcommand, you can print its help information using following command

    wikit mdx

An example output is showed below

    Process MDX file

    USAGE:
        wikit mdx [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <input>

    FLAGS:
        -c, --create     Create mdx file
        -h, --help       Prints help information
            --info       Dump basic information of mdx file
            --meta       You could specify a meta file when create mdx file. Wikit will use default meta info if this option
                         is not provided. The template is given below(include the parentheses):
                         (
                             "title": "A generic MDX dictionary",
                             "author": "An anonymous hero",
                             "description": "Just for fun",
                         )
        -p, --parse      Parse mdx file
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    OPTIONS:
        -o, --output <output>    Same with <input>
            --table <table>      The table name in the database, you must provide this parameter if input/output is a
                                 database url

    ARGS:
        <input>    The input file format depends on the value. If the value has a suffix .txt, then the input is a txt
                   file; If the value has a suffix .mdx, then the input is a mdx file; If the value is a database url
                   such as postgresql://user@localhost:5432/dictdb, then the input is a database

Some usage examples

    # Create a mdx file from text source
    wikit mdx --create --output /path/to/dict.mdx /path/to/dict.txt

    # Parse a mdx into text source
    wikit mdx --parse --output /path/to/dict.txt /path/to/dict.mdx

    # Dump information from mdx file
    wikit mdx --info /path/to/dict.mdx

# Building

- Arch Linux Environment

    - Mac Toolchain

        Install requirements from [osxcross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross) or see this
        [article](https://wapl.es/rust/2019/02/17/rust-cross-compile-linux-to-macos.html)

            git clone https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross
            cd osxcross
            wget -nc https://s3.dockerproject.org/darwin/v2/MacOSX10.10.sdk.tar.xz
            mv MacOSX10.10.sdk.tar.xz tarballs/
            UNATTENDED=yes OSX_VERSION_MIN=10.7 ./build.sh

        Remember to add `/path/to/osxcross/target/bin` to your `PATH`.

        Then add rust apple target

            rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin

        Now you can build for Mac

            CC=o64-clang CXX=o64-clang++ cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin

    - Windows Toolchain

        Install build tools

            sudo pacman -S  mingw-w64-gcc

        Install rust target and toolchain

            rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
            rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

        Now you can build for Windows

            cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

        You may encounter some issues from library minilzo-rs, please refer this
        [pull request](https://github.com/gmg137/minilzo-rs/pull/2) to fix.

# Development

Firstly, you should familiar with MDX format which is showed in the following illustraion (you can
view it in fullscreen [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikey4u/wikit/master/docs/imgs/mdx-format.svg)):
![mdx format](./docs/imgs/mdx-format.svg "mdx format")

Secondly, download a MDX dictionary from anywhere and save it to somewhere, run the following
command to do quick and dirty development

    # create MDX file
    make test-create
    # parse MDX file
    make test-parse

Finally, turn your thoughts into codes and make the contributions, cool developer!
